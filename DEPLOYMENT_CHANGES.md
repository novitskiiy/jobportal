## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Copy `env.production.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Update `.env` with production values
- [ ] Configure domain names in `.env`
- [ ] Set strong JWT secret
- [ ] Configure email settings
- [ ] Set AI service API keys

### Deployment
- [ ] Run `./deploy.sh prod` or `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
- [ ] Verify all services are healthy
- [ ] Test application functionality
- [ ] Check logs for errors

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring (optional)
- [ ] Configure backups
- [ ] Set up logging aggregation

## 🔍 Testing Deployment

### Health Check URLs
- Frontend: `http://localhost:80/health`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`
- MongoDB: Internal health check
- Redis: Internal health check
- Kafka: Internal health check

### Service Status
```bash
# Check all services
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Test application
curl http://localhost:80
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

## 📞 Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check the logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
2. Verify environment variables: `docker-compose config`
3. Check service health: `docker-compose ps`
4. Review [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for troubleshooting
5. Check [README.md](README.md) for general information

## 🎯 Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Set up domain and DNS
2. Configure SSL certificates
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Configure automated backups
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
6. Performance testing and optimization
